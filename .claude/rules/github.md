# GitHub

- always use the `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, repos, etc.)
- never fetch GitHub webpages directly; use `gh` commands instead

## Pull Requests

- PR descriptions should be concise and technically precise
- place issue references (closes, fixes, refs) at the very top of the PR body, before any headings or other content
